## 4. Transcription System

- [ ] Real-time transcription starts with recording
- [ ] Transcription updates appear in real-time
- [ ] Transcription works with uploaded audio files
- [ ] Transcription can be paused and resumed
- [ ] Multiple transcription models can be selected

## 5. Summarization System

- [ ] Real-time summarization works during recording
- [ ] Different summary types are generated correctly (overall, key points, action items)
- [ ] Summary updates appear in floating panels
- [ ] On-demand summary generation works for completed sessions
- [ ] Summary history is preserved and displayed correctly

## 6. User Interface Components

- [ ] MiniTab floating panel displays and functions correctly
- [ ] Enhanced MiniTab with all three panels functions correctly
- [ ] Session list displays all sessions
- [ ] Session detail view shows transcriptions and summaries
- [ ] Dark/light mode theming works across all components

## 7. MiniTab Panel Integration

- [ ] AI Chatbot Panel responds to queries about the meeting
- [ ] Notebook Panel allows editing and persists notes
- [ ] Panels resize correctly
- [ ] Panel content updates when switching sessions

## 8. Session Management

- [ ] Creating new sessions works
- [ ] Loading existing sessions works
- [ ] Session metadata can be edited
- [ ] Sessions can be deleted
- [ ] Active session state persists across application restarts

## 9. Export Functionality

- [ ] Markdown export includes all session content (transcripts, summaries, notes)
- [ ] PDF export formats content correctly
- [ ] Exported files are named correctly
- [ ] Export process provides user feedback
- [ ] Exported content maintains formatting

## 10. Error Handling and Recovery

- [ ] Application gracefully handles backend service failures
- [ ] WebSocket disconnections are detected and reconnection is attempted
- [ ] Audio device errors are handled appropriately
- [ ] User is notified of system errors
- [ ] Error boundary prevents application crashes

## 11. Performance Testing

- [ ] Application startup time is reasonable
- [ ] Audio processing doesn't cause significant CPU usage
- [ ] UI remains responsive during transcription and summarization
- [ ] Memory usage remains stable during long sessions
- [ ] Application handles large transcripts and summaries efficiently

## Testing Commands

### Start the integrated application
```
./start-clariimeet.bat
```

### Start frontend and backend separately
```
# Start backend
cd backend
python -m app.main

# Start frontend
cd frontend
npm run electron-dev
```

### Test audio device detection
```
curl http://localhost:8000/audio/devices
```

### Test health endpoint
```
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

### Check for running session
```
curl http://localhost:8000/sessions
```

## Known Issues and Workarounds

1. **WebSocket disconnections**: If the WebSocket disconnects, the SystemHealthMonitor component provides a reconnect button to re-establish the connection.

2. **Audio device not available**: Use the SystemHealthMonitor to refresh audio devices if they're not detected initially.

3. **Backend service unavailable**: The start-clariimeet.bat script will automatically start both frontend and backend. If there are issues, check the console output for error messages.

4. **Enhanced MiniTab not opening**: Try closing any existing MiniTab windows first, then use the keyboard shortcut or menu option to open it again.
